# Ultimate Fantasy Tileset goes here

This project employs the excellent [Ultimate Fantasy Tileset](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/ultimatefantasy). I own the tileset and have the commercial license, but the source tiles have been removed from this repo, as it is part of the license-agreement that they should be protected from copying. 

If you own the UF Tileset, you can put the subfolders of `uf_split` folder here, and BlazorRogue will be able employ the tileset.

In some future, I might make an effort to make a release where the tileset is suitable protected. Don't expect it, as this was a hobby-project to play around with Blazor and roguelikes. ;)
