# Ultimate Fantasy Tileset goes here

## Tileset

This project employs the excellent [Ultimate Fantasy Tileset](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/ultimatefantasy). I own the tileset and have the commercial license, but the tileset graphics used by this project have been removed from this repo, as it is part of the license-agreement that they should be protected from copying.

If you own the UF Tileset, you can put the subfolders of the `uf_split` folder in the UF Tileset here, and BlazorRogue will be able employ the tileset.

In some unknown future, I might make an effort to make a release where the tileset is suitably protected. Don't wait for it, though, as this is an on-and-off hobby-project of mine to play around with Blazor and roguelikes. ;)
